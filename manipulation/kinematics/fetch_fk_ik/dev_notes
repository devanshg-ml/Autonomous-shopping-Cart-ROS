status 2/10/19:
given desired hand affine, try to find solns;

approach: index the solns for sampled values of q1 (shoulder pan)

status: given q_shoulder_pan and desired hand affine, can compute 2 solns for q2,q3,q4
  q4 is elbow angle with + and - solns;
  expect 1 soln for q_elbow>0 and other for q_elbow<0

extend these:  each q1,q2,q3,q4 soln has 2 wrist solns
--> each q1 value yields 4 solns; need to check if elbow angle is out of range
    for wrist solns, need to check if wrist bend is out of range

FINISH ME!!!

after have viable solns (up to 4), compute more solns indexed by q1;
need to speed up search over indexed q1

base_link->torso_lift_link->shoulder_pan_link

to do fk/ik w/rt torso_lift_link as robot base, need a static transform of:
xyz=\"0.119525 0 0.34858\"
