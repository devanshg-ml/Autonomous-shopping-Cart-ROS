demo of fetch navigation:

start up these nodes:

roslaunch fetch_gazebo playground.launch 
rosrun mobot_gazebo_state mobot_gazebo_state
rosrun lin_steering lin_steering_wrt_gazebo_state cmd_vel:=/base_controller/command
rosrun mobot_pub_des_state mobot_pub_des_state
rosrun mobot_pub_des_state pub_des_state_path_client_3x3

this does steering w/rt gazebo states, since odom is so terrible
path client keeps repeating commands in a loop, querying pub_des_state for an empty queue
before re-sending
Node mobot_gazebo_state gets fetch state from gazebo and republishes it, acting as ideal
  localization
