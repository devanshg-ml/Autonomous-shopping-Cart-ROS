Perception:
See package pcd_images for sample PCD snapshots.

snapshots  are created using: 
`rosrun pcl_utils pcd_snapshot`  
(then rename fetch_snapshot.pcd to new, mnemonic name)

Can then publish this image using:
`rosrun pcl_utils display_pcd_file`
and respond to prompt w/ file name.  This will publish the PCD file on topic "/head_camera/depth_registered/points" with
reference frame: head_camera_rgb_optical_frame, which is viewable in rviz.

note that with torso lifted and head tilted (1 rad),
rosrun tf tf_echo torso_lift_link head_camera_rgb_optical_frame
